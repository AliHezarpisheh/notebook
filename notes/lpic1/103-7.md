# Search Text Files Using Regular Expressions

## regex

A regular expression(regex), is a sequence of characters that specifies a match pattern
in text, which describe what you want from that text.

I have been studying and practicing regex for several years but I keep forgetting it
because I don't use that a lot:) So yeah let's create a dedicated page for it. Refer to
[Regex Tutorial](../fundamentals/regex.md)

## grep

grep command search inside file(s). It can use regex and it is super fast.

```bash
grep "^ad*s$" american-english
adds
ads
as

grep -c "^ad*s$" american-english  # Return lines count.
3

grep -n "^ad*s$" american-english  # Return the line number too.
21358:adds
21569:ads
24229:as

grep -l "^ad*s$" *  # Return the files that contains the pattern.
american-english
british-english
cracklib-small
words
words.pre-dictionaries-common

grep -i "^ad*s$" *  # You can search multiple files.
american-english:As
american-english:adds
american-english:ads
american-english:as
british-english:As
british-english:adds
british-english:ads
british-english:as
cracklib-small:adds
cracklib-small:ads
cracklib-small:as
words:As
words:adds
words:ads
words:as
words.pre-dictionaries-common:As
words.pre-dictionaries-common:adds
words.pre-dictionaries-common:ads
words.pre-dictionaries-common:as

grep -i "^ad*s$" *-english  # Case-intensive. Used this >100000000000 in behinrahkar:)
american-english:As
american-english:adds
american-english:ads
american-english:as
british-english:As
british-english:adds
british-english:ads
british-english:as
```

> `-r` read all files in each directory recursively and `-v` reverse the search.

### fgrep

fixed grep(fgrep) just search the fixed pattern, not the regex. Equal to `-F` and useful
when you want to search an exact string in files where have one or multiple regex
anchors.

### egrep

extended grep(egrep) interprets patterns as extended regular expression. You see, there
are multiple implementations of regex. For example, Python has its own implementation of
regex. So some guys make grep to treat some certain characters(like `|`) as a regex
pattern. In the `grep` command, you should escape the `|` character to use it as an
anchor.

## sed

You can use regex in `sed` too! Use `-r` to tell sed you are using regex.

```bash
sed -r "s/(Z|R|J)/starts with ZRJ/" friends.txt
starts with ZRJee
starts with ZRJosha
starts with ZRJim
Xavier
Krishna
Mary
```
