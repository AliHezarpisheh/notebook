# Modify Process Execution Priorities

## Niceness

Each process in Linux has a priority and NICENESS. We won't talk about priority here.
The niceness of each process indicates that how much resource it asks from the kernel.
It ranges from -20(least nice) to 19(nicest). The nicer a process is, the fewer
resources it use, including CPU and memory.

Most processes are using the default niceness(0), but most of the important process are
using the -20 niceness. We can use `nice` and `renice` command to set or reset the
niceness of process. Also, we can see the niceness of processes in `top` and `ps -l`.
Also you can use the `r` command in top to reset the niceness of a process.

```bash

xeyes &
[1] 29245

ps -l
