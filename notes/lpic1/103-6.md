# Modify Process Execution Priorities

## Niceness

Each process in Linux has a priority and NICENESS. We won't talk about priority here.
The niceness of each process indicates that how much resource it asks from the kernel.
It ranges from -20(least nice) to 19(nicest). The nicer a process is, the fewer
resources it use, including CPU and memory.

Most processes are using the default niceness(0), but most of the important process are
using the -20 niceness. We can use `nice` and `renice` command to set or reset the
niceness of process. Also, we can see the niceness of processes in `top` and `ps -l`.
Also you can use the `r` command in top to reset the niceness of a process.

```bash

xeyes &
[1] 29245

ps -l
F S   UID     PID    PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  TTY          TIME CMD

### ssh

SSH is a network communication protocol which provides a secure encrypted channel
between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network. It operates on the TCP port
22(default). The ssh client is used to login to remote machines or execute commands on
them.

There are multiple authentication flows, the most used ones are password authentication
and public key authentication. You have used password authentication dozens of times so
let us be educated on the public key authentication:
