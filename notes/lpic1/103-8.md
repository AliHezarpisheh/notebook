# Basic File Editing

So, there are some options for terminal-based text editors there, but we are going to
learn and work more with vi(vim). You are already working a lot with neovim when reading
this section again but yeah here we go, this is the start.

## vi

vi is installed by default in most distros. It is lightweight and you should be able to
use it when you're behind a ssh connection.

```bash
whatis vi
vi (1)               - Vi IMproved, a programmer's text editor

whereis vi
vi: /usr/bin/vi /usr/share/man/man1/vi.1.gz

whatis vim
vim (1)              - Vi IMproved, a programmer's text editor

whereis vim
vim: /usr/bin/vim /etc/vim /usr/share/vim /usr/share/man/man1/vim.1.gz

readlink -f /usr/bin/vi
/usr/bin/vim.basic
```

vim has two modes:

- Command mode: Is where you go around the file, search, paste, delete, and do other
  commands. Some of them start with `:` and some are only a keypress.
- Insert mode: Is where what you type, goes into the file at the cursor position.

> To switch to the insert mode you press `i`, and for switching to the command mode you
> enter `Escape`.

### Moving Around the Cursor

These keys are available for moving around the cursor, use them in command mode:

| key      | function                               |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| h        | One character left(in the same line).  |
| j        | One line down.                         |
| k        | One line up.                           |
| l        | One character right(in the same line). |
| w        | Next word(first character).            |
| e        | Next word(last character).             |
| b        | Previous word(first character).        |
| Ctrl + f | Scroll forward one page.               |
| Ctrl + b | Scroll backward one page.              |

> Typing a number before a command will do that command `n` times. For example, `6l`
> will go 6 characters to the right.

### Jumping Around

| key       | function                                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shift + g | With no number will go to the end of the file, with number will go to line `n`. |
| Shift + h | 10H will move th cursor to the first 10th line from top of the screen.          |
| Shift + l | 3L will move th cursor to the last 3th line from top of the screen.             |

### Editing Text
