    "Stacks are data data structures following LIFO(Last In First Out) principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most common operations:\n",
    "- Push -> Add the data to the top of the stack.\n",
    "- Pop -> Remove data from the top of the stack.\n",
    "- Seek -> Get the data from top of the stack without removing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "And there are some size-related operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacks can be implemented in multiple ways. I will cover two types of implementations. One is using\n",
    "arrays(I am going to use Python lists). The array-based implementation is simple but it may be inefficient if\n",
    "the stack keeps growing and shrinking frequently. The other implementation is by using linked lists nodes.\n",
    "This could be more efficient if the stack keeps growing and shrinking but it may have more overhead due to node structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Overhead means consumption of additional computer resources, such as memory, processing time, and bandwidth but the\n",
    "> consumption do not directly contribute to the primary goal of the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stacks Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are used in most of the undo mechanism implementations.\n",
    "- Function calls. The call stack is used to manage function calls and returns.\n",
    "- Backtracking algorithms and a good load of other algorithms(and data structures!).\n",
    "- Expression evaluation. They are used in postfix, prefix, and infix evaluation. I will implement the evaluation functions in the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stacks Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "- Min stack: A special stack that supports an additional operation to retrieve the minimum element in constant time.\n",
    "- Max stack: Similar to min stack, but it retrieves the maximum element.\n",
    "- Deque(double-ended queue): A hybrid data structure supporting stack-like and queue-like operations. Elements can be removed or added from both ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can use `lists` as stacks in Python. Also, you can use `deque` for appending and popping from both ends in constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement stacks using the two methods I have talked about. Don't worry, they are simple af."
